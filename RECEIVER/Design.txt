Output structure received from the Sender console is taken as input and segregated to an array of values(temperature and SOC respectively).
The minimum and maximum of these arrays are calculated and verified.
The average of the last 5 values of these arrays are calculated and verified.
Assumptions made: The array values do not extend beyond 0 in the lower limit and 100 in the upper limit.
Functional Interface from sender to receiver is added but the linkage logic is yet to be designed.
